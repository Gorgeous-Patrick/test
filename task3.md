Move the file into the repo and then 
```bash
git add task3.md
git commit -m "Add task3"
```

You found another description of SilverFOCS:

Player experience is our first concern. Feedback from players is crucial to our improvement. We want to achieve game excellence by asking our users to use BAIDU. 

NOOO! No Baidu!
Change that to the following text:

<!-- Player experience is our first concern. Feedback from players is crucial to our improvement. We want to achieve game excellence by interacting, communicating and engaging with our players.  -->

Again, add, commit.

Right now, you found that you are in detached head mode.. You might need to create a new branch. Name this branch with task3. (As a new comer, you might not understand why you need to create a new branch, but who cares, your manager told you to do so whenever you make a new commit based on an previous commit.)

Right now, you can switch to the master branch by using the checkout command. You will see that all the files go back to the stage when you committed the master branch last time.
