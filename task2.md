Move the file into the repo and then 
```bash
git add task2.md
git commit -m "Add task2"
```

 ## "We foster talents, encourage creativity, and reward excellence"

 ~~Indeed! Donell is an evil leader, who always want to kill his employees~~

 Being an employee of SFOCS should be an cool and descent job... We should reward excellence... Let's change this.

Then you should run:

```bash
git add task2.md
git commit -m "SFOCS is not evil!"
```
(You can also do this in VSCode)
Go to your git graph. You can see that the git system has generated a new node for you.

"PUSH THE FILES!" The manager yelled!

After pushing the repo onto gitea, your managers can see it themselves.



Then you continue to edit this file.

(De-comment this paragraph.)
You thought that the data might be wrong? The SFOCS was founded in 2020?

You thought that the paragraph is an excellent description of the spirit of SFOCS so please add, commit and push it again.

But! Just after you pushed it.. Your manager told you that SFOCS was indeed founded in 2010 ;-<.. You just made a mistake. Here comes to power of Git.

Just Checkout your previous commit!
